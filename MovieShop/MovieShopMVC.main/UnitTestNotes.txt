Unit Testing: software development technique for ensuring that individuals units of code work as expected
unit testing is usually performed with methods and functions. 

It's developers job to perform unit testing. 


Database ---> Repository ---> Service ---> Controller 


We should always test for: 

Good cases,
Edge cases,
known exceptions, 
Unknown exceptions,


For Testing: 
    - Unit testing Framework in C#: MS Test, NUnit, XUnit
    - Mocking Framework: Moq ---> (most popular), FakeItEasy, NSubstitute 
    
    
MoviesServiceUnitTest Class ---> GetAll() in MoviesService Class ----> GetAll() in MoviesRepository ----> Database with Entity Framework

Unit Testing should be very fast and they should never depend on external dependencies like database.


AAA: Arrange, Act and Assert (For Unit Test)

Test-Driven Development: First write the tests and then write the code. So the tests will initially fail and then after writing code you will ensure that all the test cases are passed by the code that you have written.

Integration Testing: It is performed after unit testing and it is the kind of testing where different modules are combined together and is tested with external dependency 

Load Testing: It is performed to test the load on the application. So for example an application is test by sending request from 10,000 fake users.

Stress Testing: It is performed to test the extreme loads and see how the application reacts in the failures.



Code Coverage: It is the software testing metrics which indicated how much percentage of lines of code is been covered under testing. 
Formulae: (Number of lines of the code executed by testing algorithm/Total number of lines of code in the component)/100


White box Testing: Testing which tests the internal structure or logic of an application. Unit Testing and Integration testing comes under White box testing. 
Black box Testing: Testing is done on only outer application and is not done by the developer
